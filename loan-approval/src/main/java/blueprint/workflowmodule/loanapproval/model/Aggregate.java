/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * Nothing of this class reaches the BPMS. It is annotated {@code @NoSyncWithBPMS}, and no
 * attribute takes that back: the model has one service task and no expression reading the
 * aggregate, so the BPMS needs none of this data. The day an expression in the model reads
 * an attribute, that attribute gets {@code @SyncWithBPMS} and the rest stays where it is.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The loan request id travels anyway. A BPMS without a business key of its own is given the
 * aggregate's ID, because that is how VanillaBP finds the workflow again.
 * </p>
