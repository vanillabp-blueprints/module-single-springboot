# module-single

The base blueprint: an application module plus one workflow module packaged as a JAR, JPA
persistence, one BPMN service task. Every other blueprint is a delta on top of this
structure, so build this first and then apply the deltas.

Read
[the organisation-wide AGENTS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillabp-blueprints/.github/main/AGENTS.md)
first. It carries the procedure, the reference structure and the list of things never to do.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

|        Placeholder         |                                                          Meaning                                                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `blueprint.workflowmodule` | base package                                                                                                              |
| `loanapproval`             | use case identifier, Java package                                                                                         |
| `loan-approval`            | use case identifier, kebab case: workflow module ID, resource directory, REST path, Maven module, configuration file name |
| `loan_approval`            | BPMN process ID                                                                                                           |

`loan-approval` occurs in more places than any other placeholder, and every one of them has
to change together: the Maven module directory, the marker file `META-INF/workflow-module`,
the resource directory `src/main/resources/loan-approval/`, the configuration file
`loan-approval.yaml` and its property prefix, and the REST path. A missed occurrence does
not fail the build. It makes VanillaBP report at startup that no BPMN file was found.

That resource directory is not decoration: workflow modules share one classpath, so **all**
resources of a module have to live in the one subdirectory named after its ID, and its
classes in one Java package of their own. Only `META-INF/workflow-module` sits outside.
Adding a resource at the classpath root works until a second module ships a file of the same
name.

`retrieveCreditRating` is the task definition: the name of the `@WorkflowTask` method, the
Camunda 7 expression `${retrieveCreditRating}` and the Camunda 8 job type. Rename it in all
places or in none.

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged. Everything specific to the use case belongs into the test
extending `WorkflowModuleTest`, never into the base class.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. If the project has no workflow module yet, add a Maven module named after the use case
   and create `src/main/resources/META-INF/workflow-module` containing its ID. If a workflow
   module already exists, use it and skip to step 3.
2. Add `io.vanillabp:vanillabp-spring-boot-support` to that module and one BPMS adapter to
   the application module. Import `io.vanillabp:vanillabp-bom` in the parent POM and omit
   the version of every VanillaBP dependency.
3. Put the BPMN file into `src/main/resources/<workflow-module-id>/processes/<adapter-id>/`.
   The adapter ID is the configured one, which defaults to the adapter type.
4. Add the workflow aggregate as a JPA entity with the natural ID as `@Id`, plus a Spring
   Data repository for it. If the project already has an entity for this business case, use
   it instead of adding a second one.
5. Add `WorkflowTaskHandler` with the `@WorkflowService` annotation and one `@WorkflowTask`
   method per BPMN task, each doing nothing but calling `Service`. Never annotate the
   handler or the service methods it calls with `@Transactional`: VanillaBP runs a task in
   a transaction of its own and commits it for a `TaskException`, which a transaction
   declared here would roll back. VanillaBP rejects both cases, the annotation on the
   handler by failing the boot and the one on a bean it calls by failing the task, so an
   annotation left in place shows up as an error naming the method. Add `Workflow` with one
   method per business event the process has to learn about. Add `Service` with the business
   methods. If the project already has a business service for this use case, add the methods
   there instead of creating a second one. Never inject `ProcessService` into it, and never
   merge the two workflow classes: `Service` uses `Workflow` and is used by
   `WorkflowTaskHandler`, so merging them creates a circular bean reference.
6. Add GET endpoints starting the process and showing the aggregate.
7. Copy `LoanApprovalIT` and adapt it to the use case.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` has to pass: it starts a workflow and waits until the service task has
written to the aggregate. If the task is never executed, the wiring between BPMN and code is
wrong, and the startup log names which BPMN task has no method or which method has no task.
`ApplicationSmokeTest` passing means the application boots with the module on the classpath.

Do not report success without having run this.
