# Application plus one workflow module

[![Apache License V.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

This is the base blueprint, the normal case, and the one to start from. A workflow module
is a JAR containing BPMN models and the code implementing them; an application pulls it in
as a dependency and decides which business process engine is used. If you build a business
process application with VanillaBP, this is the shape it has.

## What this blueprint shows

![The loan approval process](docs/loan_approval.png)

A loan approval process consisting of one service task. Starting it stores a *workflow
aggregate* and starts a workflow in the BPMS, the service task fills the aggregate, and the
process ends.

What is worth looking at:

- The workflow module is a JAR of its own (`loan-approval/`) and cannot be started alone. It
  declares itself by the marker file `META-INF/workflow-module` containing its ID.
- Everything it owns is named after that ID. There is no classloader isolation between
  workflow modules, they share one classpath, so each module needs a namespace of its own in
  two places: a unique Java package (`blueprint.workflowmodule.loanapproval`) and a single
  resource subdirectory (`src/main/resources/loan-approval/`) holding *all* of its resources.
  The marker file is the one exception; it has to sit at `META-INF/`.
- It knows no BPMS. Its only VanillaBP dependency is `vanillabp-spring-boot-support`, which
  deliberately exposes no engine API. The adapter is a dependency of the application
  (`application/`). BPMN files are the only thing that differs between engines, which is why
  they live in `processes/<adapter-id>/`.
- It brings its own configuration. `loan-approval/loan-approval.yaml` inside the module is
  loaded automatically and takes precedence over `application.yaml`. Configuration a module
  needs stays with the module instead of scattering across the project.
- One class per direction of the BPMN wiring. `Service` is the business code and never
  touches VanillaBP. `Workflow` is what the application tells the process and the only place
  `ProcessService` is injected. `WorkflowTaskHandler` is what the process tells the
  application: it carries `@WorkflowService` and every `@WorkflowTask` method and calls
  `Service`. Here each of them forwards a single line, which is exactly why it is worth
  seeing: the shape stays the same once a process needs messages correlated or tasks
  completed, and it is what keeps the two beans from depending on each other.
- It is tested on its own. The integration test lives in the workflow module and brings a
  minimal application with it; the application only carries a smoke test.

There is no `vanillabp.*` property anywhere: with one adapter on the classpath and one
workflow module, VanillaBP derives the adapter, the module and the location of the BPMN
files by convention.

## Running it

Requires a JDK 21. Camunda 7 is embedded, so nothing else has to run:

```bash
mvn install verify
```

Running it on another BPMS is a Maven profile, not one line of Java changes:

```bash
mvn install verify -Pcamunda8
```

Camunda 8 is a remote engine, so a cluster has to run and be pointed at. Start one, then add
its address to `application/src/main/resources/application.yaml` and to
`loan-approval/src/test/resources/application.yaml`:

```yaml
vanillabp:
  adapters:
    camunda8:
      rest-address: http://localhost:8080
      # Nothing else is needed: this adapter keeps workflow modules apart by nothing at all
      # ('name-clash-avoidance: none') unless told otherwise, because a cluster started from
      # the stock image has multi-tenancy switched off and rejects a tenant per module. The
      # adapter warns about it while booting - with one workflow module the identifiers are
      # unique anyway. Set 'name-clash-avoidance: use-prefix' to have VanillaBP prefix them.
```

Without it the application does not boot, and says so:

```
Camunda 8 adapter 'camunda8' is used but not configured: the property
'vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address' is missing.
```

That is the normal way to work with VanillaBP: configuration is validated while booting, and
the message names what to do.

Start the application:

```bash
mvn -pl application spring-boot:run
```

Booting logs a warning per workflow module, and it is meant to be read rather than filtered
away. Both Camunda adapters start out with `name-clash-avoidance: none`, so the identifiers
of this module reach the engine as they are, and the adapter names what it could do instead
and asks for a decision. With one workflow module nothing can collide, which is why this
blueprint leaves the setting alone and keeps its configuration free of `vanillabp.*`. An
application that wants the question answered answers it once:

```yaml
vanillabp:
  adapters:
    camunda7:
      accept-unscoped-identifiers: true
```

That is a promise that the identifiers are unique across all workflow modules, and it turns
the warning into a debug line. Which modes a BPMS offers, and why switching the mode later is
a migration rather than a configuration change, is in
[the wiki](https://github.com/vanillabp/adapter-platform-integration/wiki/Workflow-modules#how-name-clashes-are-avoided).

Start a loan approval. This is the only URL you need:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/start?amount=5000
```

It answers with the ID of the loan request and logs the URL showing the result:

```
Loan approval '0f7c…' started
Credit rating of loan approval '0f7c…' is 50
Show the result -> http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/0f7c…
```

Opening that URL shows the aggregate, including the credit rating the service task wrote.

While the application runs on Camunda 7, Camunda's own web applications are served at

```
http://localhost:8080/camunda
```

Log in with `demo` / `demo`. Cockpit shows what the engine is doing with the workflows
started above, which is the view the logged URLs cannot give: where an instance stands, and
why a job failed. The user comes from
`application/src/main/camunda7/resources/camunda7-webapps.yaml` and exists so that the
blueprint can be operated without setting one up; an application with an identity provider
of its own leaves that section out.

The Camunda 8 profile ships neither the dependency nor that file. Its tooling is part of
the cluster, and the file names a Camunda 7 adapter id, which VanillaBP would rightly
refuse to start with.

| `.../loanapproval/config/LoanApprovalProperties.java`                                  | the module's own configuration                                                                                      |
| `application/.../Application.java`                                                     | the Spring Boot application; its package is the parent of the module's, so scanning finds everything                |
| `loan-approval/src/test/.../LoanApprovalIT.java`                                       | starts a real workflow and waits for the aggregate to have been filled                                              |
| `loan-approval/src/test/.../WorkflowModuleTest.java`                                   | the base class it inherits from: booting the module and waiting for workflow progress, identical in every blueprint |
| `application/src/test/.../ApplicationSmokeTest.java`                                   | boots the application, which is where VanillaBP validates that every BPMN task is wired to code                     |

The order of events: `ApiController` calls `Service#initiateLoanApproval`, which builds the
aggregate and tells `Workflow` what happened, namely `loanRequested`, not "start the
process". `Workflow#loanRequested` calls `ProcessService#startWorkflow`, and VanillaBP
persists the aggregate and starts the process in the same transaction, so an aggregate
without a workflow, or the other way round, cannot happen. The BPMS then reaches the service
task and calls `WorkflowTaskHandler#retrieveCreditRating`, which does nothing but hand over
to `Service#assessCreditRating`, with the aggregate loaded before and saved after the call.
That happens in a transaction VanillaBP owns, which is why neither of the two classes
declares one of its own. Only the method the API calls does, since starting a workflow has
to run in a transaction. Putting `@Transactional` on a task handler anyway fails the boot
with a message naming the method, and putting it on a bean the handler calls fails the task
while it runs, so this is a rule VanillaBP enforces rather than one to remember.

That the test waits instead of asserting immediately is not accidental: a BPMS runs tasks in
its own transactions, and a remote one does so eventually. A test assuming otherwise passes
on one engine and fails on the next.
